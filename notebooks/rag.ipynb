      "Content of a chunk: July 2013One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinatoris to do things that don't scale. A lot of would-be founders believethat startups either take off or don't. You build something, makeit available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat apath to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case themarket must not exist. [1]Actually startups take off because the founders make them takeoff. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, butusually it takes some sort of push to get them going. A goodmetaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before theygot electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keepgoing, but there was a separate and laborious process to get itgoing.RecruitThe most common unscalable thing founders have to do at thestart is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. Youcan't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and getthem.Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, andthe problem they solved was an urgent one. If anyone could havesat back and waited for users, it was Stripe. But in fact they'refamous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.Startups building things for other startups have a big pool ofpotential users in the other companies we've funded, and nonetook better advantage of it than Stripe. At YC we use the term\"Collison installation\" for the technique they invented. Morediffident founders ask \"Will you try our beta?\" and if the answer\n"
